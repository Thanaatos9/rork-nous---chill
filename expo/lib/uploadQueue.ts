/**
 * The photos someone added but that have not reached the server yet.
 *
 * Uploading used to happen while the screen waited: twelve photos meant twelve
 * uploads of hesitation before "Enregistrer ma review" did anything visible,
 * and leaving the screen — or the app — during that window lost the lot. The
 * queue moves the waiting out of the way. The review is saved, the screen
 * closes, and the files leave on their own.
 *
 * What the queue guarantees, on every platform: nothing is lost. A job survives
 * the screen closing, the app being killed, a flight-mode tunnel, a failed
 * request. It is retried when the app comes back to the foreground, and again
 * at the next launch, until it lands or gives up loudly.
 *
 * What it does NOT guarantee: transfers do not continue while the app is
 * suspended. iOS stops JavaScript seconds after backgrounding; a transfer in
 * flight is cut and resumes on return. Making it survive suspension needs the
 * system's own uploader (NSURLSession background session, iOS only) — a layer
 * that would sit on top of this one, not replace it.
